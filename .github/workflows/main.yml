# 🧠 Business Description Comparison & Ranking System

## 📌 Problem Statement

We have business description data from **four vendors**:

- **D&B**
- **UCC**
- **Livesight**
- **Creditsafe**

Each vendor provides business descriptions in their **own format**. We also have an **internal standard format** that we use for comparison.

---

## 🎯 Objective

1. **Compare** each vendor's business description against our internal format.
2. **Score** each description based on how well it aligns with our format.
3. **Rank** the vendors from **1 to 4** based on their scores.
4. **Automatically extract** the top-ranked (Rank 1) business description and **store it in a new sheet** within the same Excel file.

---

## 🧮 Scoring Criteria

> ⚠️ **Note**: This scoring function is a placeholder for prototyping purposes only. It will be replaced with a more robust, rule-based or ML/NLP-driven model in future iterations.

A placeholder scoring mechanism will be implemented initially. This will later be updated with a detailed rubric based on:

- Keyword matching
- Structural alignment
- Completeness
- Tone and clarity
- Semantic similarity

### 🔢 Error Categories & Weightage

| Error Type                                      | Weight     |
|------------------------------------------------|------------|
| Primary Business                                | Critical - 1.0 |
| Name/Ownership Info                             | High - 0.75 |
| Spelling Errors (Proper Nouns)                  | High - 0.75 |
| Grammar / Product Mismatch                      | Medium - 0.5 |
| Name Change Month / Multiple Ownership Lines    | Low - 0.25 |
| Clients / Distribution / Partnerships           | Low - 0.25 |
| Formatting / Spacing / Additional Offices       | Low - 0.25 |

## 🏆 Ranking Logic

- Vendors will be ranked **based on their scores** (highest = Rank 1).
- In case of a **tie**, a random selection may be used to break the tie (subject to future refinement).

---

## 📤 Output Requirements

- A **new sheet** in the same Excel file will be created.
- This sheet will contain:
  - The **business description** of the top-ranked vendor.
  - *(Optional: Additional metadata like vendor name, score, etc., can be added later.)*

### 📝 Sample Output Sheet Structure

| Company Name | Vendor     | Business Description                                | Score | Rank |
|--------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------|------|
| ABC, Inc.    | Creditsafe | ABC, Inc. manufactures and distributes...           | 9.5   | 1    |
| XYZ Corp.    | D&B        | XYZ Corp. is a holding company that...              | 8.0   | 2    |

---

## 📁 Data Format

- All data will be provided in a **single Excel file**.
- Vendor data may be organized in:
  - **Separate sheets**, or
  - **Separate columns** in the same sheet
- The internal format will also be included in the same file.

---

## 🧰 Automation Workflow

### Step 1: Read Excel File
- Load all vendor data and internal format into memory.

### Step 2: Preprocess Descriptions
- Clean and normalize text (e.g., remove special characters, lowercase, etc.)

### Step 3: Compare with Internal Format
- Use a scoring function (placeholder for now) to evaluate each vendor’s description.

### Step 4: Assign Scores
- Store scores for each vendor in a structured format (e.g., DataFrame).

### Step 5: Rank Vendors
- Rank vendors based on scores (highest = Rank 1).
- If tie: randomly assign rank among tied vendors.

### Step 6: Export Best Description
- Create a **new sheet** in the same Excel file.
- Add the **Rank 1** vendor’s business description to this sheet.

## ✍️ Grammar & Style Rules

- Use **present tense** even for acquired or out-of-business entities.
- Avoid promotional words like “leading,” “innovative,” “state-of-the-art.”
- Use **active voice**: _“The company provides…”_ instead of _“The company is a provider of…”_
- Avoid contractions (e.g., use “does not” instead of “doesn’t”).
- Use commas before “and” in lists of 3 or more items.
- Use semicolons to separate complex list items.
- Avoid “comprises of”; use “comprises” or “is comprised of.”
- Use “such as,” “including,” or “that includes” instead of “like.”

## 🧪 Placeholder Scoring Function (To Be Updated)

```python
def score_description(vendor_desc, internal_format):
    # Placeholder logic
    score = 0
    if "primary business" in vendor_desc.lower():
        score += 1
    if "products" in vendor_desc.lower():
        score += 1
    if "clients" in vendor_desc.lower():
        score += 1
    return score

## ✅ Future Enhancements

The following improvements are planned for future iterations of this system:

- **Define a robust scoring rubric**  
  Replace the placeholder logic with a detailed, rule-based scoring system aligned with business description standards.

- **Add NLP-based semantic similarity scoring**  
  Use language models or embeddings to compare vendor descriptions with the internal format more intelligently.

- **Include metadata in output**  
  Add columns like vendor name, score, and rank to the output sheet for better traceability.

- **Handle tie-breaking with more intelligent logic**  
  Instead of random selection, use secondary criteria (e.g., length, keyword density) to resolve ties.

- **Add logging and error handling**  
  Ensure the script logs processing steps and handles missing or malformed data gracefully.
